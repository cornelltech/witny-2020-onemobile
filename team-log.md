# Team Log

## 1/6/2020
### Done today
* Downloaded all the apps and investigated each one 
* Created a list of important features for our NYC ONE APP
* Created a list of each app's features including the app's purpose, the limitations of the app, the ratings, the publisher
* Figured out what apps to eliminate, and what features of the good apps to eliminate
* Discussed what apps were effective vs. what apps were ineffective
* Discussed maybe making two or three apps because not all of the features relate to each other
* Decided on our final features for the apps
### Work for tomorrow
* Choose overall the most useful features
* Make a dichotomy of the features
* Discuss user personas/archetypes and how it affects the app's design
