* Downloaded all the apps and investigated each one 
* Created a list of important features for our NYC ONE APP
* Created a list of each app's features including the app's purpose, the limitations of the app, the ratings, the publisher
* Figured out what apps to eliminate, and what features of the good apps to eliminate
* Discussed what apps were effective vs. what apps were ineffective
* Discussed maybe making two or three apps because not all of the features relate to each other
